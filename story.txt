One day our stunning and beautiful Professor Mehlhase was walking the streets of Berlin.
Sie liebte es brot zu essen. (She loved to eat bread).
Pulled up in a bmw with cookies.
Is she walking? driving? Mehlhase didn't know due to her concept of time being absolutely messed up because of a long crazy day at the local beirgarten.
She went to the nearest baeckerei and asked what they had on the menu.
The baker said apple pie and bread. 
But she said "I want a bratwurst and beer instead!"
The baker zur√ºckgegangen, and asked the professor to leave. "We are not agile in our menu like that"
